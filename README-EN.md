# Orchid Linux 

![Orchid Logo](img/Orchid-Think.png)

Orchid is a modern and well designed distro of Gentoo for PC and Laptop users.

[Version Française](https://github.com/wamuu-sudo/orchid/blob/main/README.md)

Current version of the project : Pre-release 1.3.2

We highly recommend joining our Discord server to be kept up-to-date with the updates, and an overall better support [Orchid Linux](https://discord.gg/Wegk7a6TQ8)

The idea behind this project is to deliver a usable GUI Gentoo install, with modern tools and a sleek design, while providing a fast installation.

Side note, Gentoo isn't recommended for new linux users, but, trying it is an educative experience.

Warning, eventhough this project is deployable and ready-to-use, issues can accure.

New editions are availible :

- DWM & DWM Gaming.
- Gnome, Gnome Gaming and Gnome Gaming SystemD.
- KDE Plasma (WIP).
- XFCS Gaming


Gaming editions come bundled with 32bits libs, vulkan support, wine, and much more.

We also offer the installation of the [TkG](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg) kernel through our tools.

An installation guide is availible [here](https://github.com/juliiine/orchid/blob/main/INSTALLATION-EN.md).

A documentation page about our tools is availible [here](https://github.com/wamuu-sudo/orchid/blob/main/TOOLS-EN.md).

What makes Orchid different from other distros:

- We are not a complete OS per-say, but more of a Gentoo "rice".
- We mostly focus on advanced users, even if the installation is less of a hastle.
- For now, we do not have an install script, nor a graphical installer, the installation is done in CLI (faster and simpler than the default Gentoo experience)
- All Gentoo packages are availible.
- We use the gentoo-kernel-bin Kernel, which follows the LTS channel of linux. Thus making debuging easy and faster.
- `eix` pre-installed.
- GNOME , KDE Plasma, and Suckless DWM availible for install.
- A complete dwm environnement `orchid-dwm` availible for download with great optimisations and a sleek design.
- Firefox pre-installed as a binary so you are ready to go ASAP.
- Only OpenRC installs are available, while SystemD is usable on Gentoo aswell.
- We took the decision to integrate Flatpak by default for practicity raisons. It is also used for the Gaming tools in their respective editions. 

Different archives are availible in the links provided in the installation guide.
